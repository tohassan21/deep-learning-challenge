Module 21 Challenge: Deep Learning

Overview:
- This challenge explores the use of machine learning and neural networks and the use of features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup.

Sources:
- The data used is from the charity_data.csv from the provided cloud URL.
URL = "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m21/lms/starter/charity_data.csv"

How to run:
- Open the jupyter notebook file titled Starter_Code.ipynb in the Deep Learning Challenge folder.
- Run the entire file (all of the cells).

Note:
- I was not able to achieve at least a 75% model accuracy score despite 3 attempts at changing the model.
- Noted in the file are the changes in each attempt.
- Each model is saved in an H5 file in the Deep Learning Challenge folder.
- The written report on the neural network model (step 4) is in the Written Report.md file.
